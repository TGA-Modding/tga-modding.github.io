TGAPI (The Glitched API) is a mod that aims to make it easier to make mods for the game.
It adds helpers that make managing levels, animatronics, achievements and more much simpler.
Due to the game using Unity's PlayerPrefs system to hold progress and achievements, directly loading levels results in hard to read code.
