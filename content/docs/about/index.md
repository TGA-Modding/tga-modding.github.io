The Glitched Attraction is a FNaF fangame made by PowerLine Studios. It is built with Unity and compiled with Mono, meaning it is relatively easy to make mods for.
All of the main game assets are stored in a single asset bundle, `data.unity3d`, as the game loads in the level around you rather than transporting you between scenes*.
All of the C# code for the game is stored in the `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file, and can be easily decompiled with a tool like [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy)

*The game does transport ypu between scenes sometimes, but the majority of loading is done around the player.
